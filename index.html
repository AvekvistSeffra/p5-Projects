                    <br>
                    You might know me from Landon, my game on Steam, or maybe you know me from my game
                    engine live streaming on Twitch, or my other GitHub repository where I am making a
                    game engine in Rust using the Vulkan API.
                    I'm also making YouTube videos.
                    <br><br>
                    If you don't know of me from anything, then let me introduce myself.
                    I'm a 17-year old guy from Sweden and I enjoy programming different things.
                    I'm currently in the second year of high school and I have a few courses where
                    I can work on different things, code related. Most of the things I'm making there
                    will probably get posted on my GitHub or something.
                </p>

                <p>
                    This repository, along this page, is just for showcasing some p5.js projects that I'm
                    working on. It will probably be machine learning, for the most part, but it could be
                    a lot of other things as well if my mind is along certain tracks.
